### From the Principal's Desk

"Twinkle twinkle little star, how I wonder what you are?  
Up above the world so high, Like a diamond in the sky"

This most popular nursery rhyme would have become history had the sun, moon and stars been within the reach of human hands. **"There is sufficient in the world for a man's need but not for man's greed"** rightly stated by our great leader Mahatma Gandhi. We are all part of the environment and what we do to the environment we also do to ourselves and our future.

We have to educate others to create environmental awareness and consciousness - Education changes people, it replaces the empty mind with an open one. We as educators must instill into the young minds at the **grassroots level** that they *must be* the change they want to see in the future. Our continuous involvement in various environmental programmes and activities clearly shows the school and students love and care for the environment. Not only this but the students now are consciously doing their bit to create a *happy and green environment* for the present and the **FUTURE** also. **The big question is if not us WHO? if not now WHEN?**

In the end a few golden words borrowed from the Iron Lady – Margaret Thatcher's speech in the UN on Green Resolution:

"Our ability to come together to stop or limit damage to the world's environment will be perhaps the greatest test of how far we can act as a world community."
